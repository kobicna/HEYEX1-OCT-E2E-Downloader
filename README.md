# HEYEX1-OCT-E2E-Downloader
This repository contains the code for automating the download of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans acquired through the Heidelberg Spectralis platform. The script, developed in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and integrated with Microsoft Excel, enables efficient extraction of OCT scans. The method was validated through a study conducted at Hadassah University Hospital Ophthalmology Department, where it successfully exported a large volume of scans from patient records with notable time efficiency. The automation process leveraged specific screen resolution, and fixed pixel positions, and ensured that Heyex, the imaging software, was opened in full-screen mode to optimize performance.

**Contents:**
1.	Main Macro Script: The primary VBA script responsible for automating the export process of OCT scans from the Heidelberg Spectralis platform. This script serves as the core functionality for downloading OCT scans. Note that while the main script provides a foundation for automation, some modifications might be necessary to adapt it to specific user environments or requirements.
2.  README.md: Instructions and guidelines for utilizing the script, including prerequisites and usage guidelines.

**Usage Instructions:**
1.	Download the macro script from the repository.
2.	Open the Excel workbook containing the patient records and execute the macro according to provided guidelines.
3.	Execute the macro; ensure Heyex, the Heidelberg Spectralis imaging software, is opened in full-screen mode, alongside specific screen resolution and fixed pixel positions, for optimal performance.
4.	Follow prompts to initiate the download process.
5.	Monitor progress and retrieve exported OCT scans upon completion.

**Disclaimer:** This script is provided as-is and should be used with caution. It is recommended to review and adapt the code to suit specific requirements and ensure compliance with relevant policies regarding data handling and automation.
